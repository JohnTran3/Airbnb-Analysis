# Airbnb Analysis
 Interpreting Airbnb data
Collaborators: Johann Piedras, Marianne Adamian, Alvin Hui, John Tran

In this project, we analyzed a data set from Airbnb. This dataset was about Airbnb Hosts in the five Burroughs of New York which was from a time span of 2008 to 2015. We created questions like does a certain location affect price and used many data analysis methods such as linear regression, knn, and data visualization to interpret any association in this data.

Included in this repo is the report and the code.
